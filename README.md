# FlyX369

# eVTOL Prototype Mission Specification (v0.1)

## Purpose
Design and build a **small-scale tilt-rotor eVTOL prototype** (1–3 kg) to demonstrate:
- Vertical takeoff and landing (hover like a drone).
- Forward transition to fixed-wing flight using tilting rotors.
- Autonomous waypoint navigation using PX4 + ROS2.
- Serve as a learning platform for scaling toward a commercial passenger eVTOL.

---

## Payload
- Prototype: 1–2 kg max payload (sensor, small package, extra battery).
- Future scale: 80–100 kg passenger or equivalent cargo.

---

## Range
- Prototype: 5–10 km range (LiPo battery limited).
- Future scale: 50–150 km range (high-energy density batteries or hybrid power).

---

## Flight Time
- Prototype: 10–15 minutes safe endurance.
- Future scale: 30–60 minutes target endurance.

---

## Speed Target
- Prototype: 50–100 km/h in forward flight.
- Future scale: 150–250 km/h.

---

## Environment
- Prototype: outdoor open field, VLOS (visual line-of-sight).
- Future: urban/suburban corridors, BVLOS (beyond visual line-of-sight).

---

## Constraints
- Prototype budget: < $1000–$1500.
- Weight limit: < 3 kg (airframe + electronics + payload).
- Timeline: 1 month to flying tilt-rotor prototype.
- Tools: ROS2, PX4, Gazebo/AirSim, Fusion 360 for CAD.
